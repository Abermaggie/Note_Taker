## Description
This application was written to address the daily struggle of a busy life when it remembering details and tasks can be difficult.  This app eliminates the need to carry a notepad and pen as it easily allows for note taking on the go!  It utilizes a notepad format allowing space to add a main header and a body to write the details/notes one would like to record.  Once complete, the note can be easily saved and stored in a note list that stays visible while the app remains open.  This way, the user can go back and review or edit their notes by simply tapping on the note title.  When the note is no longer useful, the user simply clicks the delete button and upon refresh of the application, the note is removed.
